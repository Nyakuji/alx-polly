# üß† AI Integration Strategy

This project will leverage AI, specifically through IDE/CLI agents, to accelerate development, improve code quality, and maintain high-quality documentation.

### Code Generation

I will use AI to scaffold new features and components. This includes:
- **Component Scaffolding:** Generating boilerplate for new React components, including props, state management, and basic JSX structure.
- **API Route Generation:** Creating new API endpoints in Next.js, including request/response types and basic logic for interacting with the Supabase backend.
- **Feature Prototyping:** Quickly building out new features, such as a user profile page or a poll results dashboard, which can then be refined.

### Testing

AI will be a key partner in ensuring the application is robust and reliable.
- **Unit Test Generation:** Creating Jest tests for individual functions and components, ensuring that business logic is correct. For example, generating tests for a service function like `poll-service.ts`.
- **Integration Test Scaffolding:** Generating integration test templates that can be filled in to test user flows, such as creating a poll or casting a vote.
- **Test Refinement:** Analyzing existing tests to suggest improvements, add more edge cases, and increase overall test coverage.

### Documentation

AI will help maintain clear and comprehensive documentation.
- **Docstrings & Inline Comments:** Generating JSDoc comments for functions and clarifying complex code blocks with concise inline comments.
- **README Maintenance:** Assisting in updating this `README.md` with new features, architectural changes, and setup instructions.

### Context-Aware Techniques

To ensure the AI generates accurate and relevant code, I will provide it with specific context:
- **API & Schema Definitions:** Supplying the AI with the Supabase database schema or API specifications to generate correct data-access code.
- **File Trees & Code Snippets:** Providing the project's file structure or the content of relevant files (`lib/types.ts`, `app/polls/[id]/page.tsx`, etc.) to give the AI a clear understanding of the existing codebase.
- **Diffs for Refactoring:** When refactoring code, I will provide a `git diff` to the AI, allowing it to understand the proposed changes and provide more accurate suggestions or implementations.
